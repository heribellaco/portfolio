## Alternative Ways to Treat and Manage Keratoconus and Visual Problems

Are you dealing with keratoconus?

You're not alone - keratoconus can limit your vision and make it difficult to do things like night driving and reading, and it sucks.

But what to do?

1.- **Eat healthy and supplement with B2 vitamins\.**

Eating healthy food is the most important thing you can do for your body. Eating a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, is key for optimal health.

B2 vitamins, also known as riboflavin, are essential for healthy cell metabolism, helping your body to produce energy from the foods you eat. B2 vitamins also have antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.

2.- **Avoid sleeping with your contacts**.

Sleeping with your contact lenses can lead to serious eye health issues, including infections and corneal ulcers. Remove contact lenses before sleeping, no matter how tired you may be.  

Here are some tips to help you:

* Set a nightly reminder on your phone or watch to take out your contacts.  

* Place your contact lens case and contact solution next to your bed so you don’t forget to take out your contacts before you go to sleep.

* Avoid wearing your contact lenses for longer than the recommended time.  

3.- **Try better fitted contact lenses or scleral lenses.**  

Getting fitted with new contact lenses can be a great way to improve your vision and your overall comfort. Whether you’re looking to switch from traditional soft lenses to something more advanced, like scleral lenses, it’s important to talk to your eye doctor about the best fit for you.  

4.- **Get enough sleep.**

Getting enough sleep is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. Sleep helps your body recover from the day, allowing you to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. It also helps your brain process information, improves your memory, and contributes to a healthy immune system.

Avoid screens and other sources of blue light for at least an hour before bed, and try to avoid caffeine and sugary foods in the evening.

5.- **Rest your eyes**

Close them every once in a while, and take breaks from your contact lenses.

Resting your eyes every once in a while is one of the most effective and natural ways to give them a break from the strain of staring at a digital device.

By closing your eyes, you allow them to rest and relax, which can prevent the development of eyestrain or other vision problems.

6.- **Drink enough water and breathe deeply to relax.**

7.- **Never rub your eyes or squint to see better.**

8.- **Relax your neck and face and look into the distance.**

In general, anything that improves your health will indirectly benefit your eyes.

There are other holistic alternative ideas to try, you can read about them here in this blog, in my book *The Keratoconus User-Guide* or in my personal page below.
